### Hi I'm Eric Zeller 👋

🧔‍♂️ This is my Github profile for source code related to some of my Bethel Tech school projects.
<br><br>
👨‍🎓 I graduated in Dec 2023 from Bethel School of Technololgy in Redding, CA, as a FULL STACK DEVELOPER. I built over 50 small scale applications during the program using various tech stacks like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, C#, SQL, MongoDB, Angular, Ionic, .NET, AWS Cloud Concepts, and Google Firebase/Firestore.
<br><br>
🤓 I'm currently learning everything I can get my hands on 🤣
<br><br>
🖥 Enjoy looking through the progression of different projects I built that led to the culmination of Full Sail.
